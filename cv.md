## About me

I’m highly motivated beginner in web development. 
I have little coding experience so far, but I believe my determination, 
fast learning abilities and attention to detail will help me 
to complete this course. My goal is to improve my coding skills and get plenty of practice. 
I’m looking forward to learning new skills and exploring new opportunities with RS School.

## Code examples

~~~javascript

return 1;

} else {

return recursiveFactorial(n - 1) * n;

}

}

alert(recursiveFactorial(5));
